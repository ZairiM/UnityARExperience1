The main scene is ProyectoFinal, this scene is a memorama and has two targets, and you can touch the cubes, when you touch a cube it spawns a sound and a food model you need to touch the same food model in the other target. While you see a timer, when you finish and find all pairs you see a win message and can play again.

In 17nov the experience starts in a scene, but the scene&#39;s camera is your device camera, you need two targets, target A and B. B has a cube and A has many cubes they can be touched by B, when it happens A cubes do actions like get gravity and fall or rotate.
